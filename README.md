To see a World in a Grain of Sand
And a Heaven in a Wild Flower 
Hold Infinity in the palm of your hand 
And Eternity in an hour

Auguries of Innocence
By William Blake

## abstract

much has been explored on norns with interactive instruments and tools, but what about a single static/pre-scripted/unchanging/microchanging composition? what possibilities exist within the context of a _song_? songs, of course, can be different each time they are played/performed...

auguries of innocence from william blake has really resonated with me this year. infinity in the palm of your hand is an apt metaphor for phones in 2020... i thought this would be a nice theme in the spirit of the perenial [disquiet junto](https://disquiet.com/).
